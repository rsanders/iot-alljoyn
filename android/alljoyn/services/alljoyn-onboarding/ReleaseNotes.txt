Features added in Version 14.06
-------------------------------

Android: Added Onboarding Manager library that streamlines the process of onboarding and offboarding for Android application developers. 
The Android Onboarding Manager encapsulates the Android Wi-Fi and AllJoyn APIs that are part of the process.
A sample Android application that tests the Onboarding Manager is included.

OpenWRT Onboarding service library is replaced with a daemon application. This way there is only a single instance of Onboarding app running on a device.
During connect to a new network, the onboarding application restarts the AllJoyn Routing Node.
